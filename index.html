                    <p>
                        <strong>Concept Overview:</strong>
                        <span class="gameTitle"></span> is an RTS that immerses players in the strategic and tactical challenges of World War I. The game emphasizes a balance between economy, strategy and real time action.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Inspiration:</strong>
                        Gameplay is heavily inspired by Age of Empires II and Knights of Honour. The artistic and thematic style is heavily inspired by the Grimdark aesthetic frequently found in Warhammer 40,000.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Core Gameplay:</strong>
                        Players assume the roles of historical factions, orchestrating large-scale military operations on the battlegrounds of Europe. The game features large strategic decisions like research, production and moving regiments, and close up fast tactical play.
                    </p>

                    <p><strong>Unique Selling Points:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Fresh Experience:</strong>
                            WWI is a very underrepresented theatre in gaming, only 1 in every 36 RTS games are about WWI (approx). This gives players a much wider range of new units, tactics and experiences to explore than many RTS games offer. This provides a young game studio a blank canvas to work with.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Strategic Depth:</strong>
                            A lot of moving parts that are packaged neatly into <a href="#maps">2 distinct map scales</a> and <a href="#generalOrders">4 distinct tactical stages</a>. Both small decisions and large decisions can have meaningful impact on the outcome.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Olde World Charm, Modern Mechanical Monstrosities:</strong>
                            The WWI period intersected pre-industrial equipment and tactics with the horrors of death delivered at a new industrial scale. This game will capture the blend of old and new in a way not seen before. A potent cocktail of cavalry charges and mustard gas, Napoleonic era formations and analogue targeting computers. Unique!
                        </li>

                <p>
                    The game loop is divided between the macro and micro management of 2 maps and 4 General Orders that run in real time.
                    The 2 maps cover different scales of the battlefield, a large view of whole regions or a granular view of specific battlefields,
                    zooming with the mouse roller will switch scales. The stages of General Orders are a more abstract concept but are
                    basically like "ages" in Age of Empires, levels of advancement that have requirements to reach and provide new opportunities
                    at each stage. General Orders cannot be undone once called up. There is no limitation on where anything can be built or moved but there are sensible places to build and move.
                    Like building barracks in urban areas or steel foundries close to iron deposits is a good idea. But there might be good reasons to
                    build or move near or in enemy areas, like field hospitals or incursions behind enemy lines.

                    Here is a more detailed description of the game loops sections:

                                This is high level map view covers whole regions for macro management. A player uses this map view to manage
                                production, research and moving entire armies. At this scale, the player handles economy like workers,
                                resource management, production of units and logistics (roads, rail, shipping). The strategic map view will handle nearly all the economy game elements
                                with very few military elements, just strategic bombing.

                                This detailed map view covers specific battlefields for micro management. The player has tight,
                                responsive control over units. The player will command individual units to
                                collect supplies, dig (gun pits, trenches, dugouts, tunnels), build (wire, lay mines, lookout posts, machine gun nests),
                                move or attack. Using hotkeys will be crucial. Most of the military game elements are handled at this scale with
                                very few economy elements handled here, just wood chopping for lumber. There is an additional layer to this map which
                                is that players can engage in tunnel warfare by digging through 3 subterranean layers under the battlefield.

                        The stages of the game are called "General Orders". Each order affects economic and military elements. Although the button to call up the next General Order
                        is accessed through the capital city located on the Strategic Map, the order will affect all areas of the game. General Orders are as follows:

                        To call up the next General Order the player needs to pay certain resources, have certain buildings and unlock certain
                        technologies. The requirement for the next General Order increases but so do the rewards of each General Order,
                        access to new and better units and buildings, accesses to new and better upgrades on existing units and buildings.
                        Calling up the next General Order before your opponent will often put a player at an advantage but there may be some
                        situations/strategies where spending resources on increasing economy or military is more advantageous
                        than calling up the next General Order.

                <h3 id="story-and-setting">Story and Setting</h3>
                <p>
                    Story mode will be a feature to implement if there is time, single player skirmish gameplay will be the primary focus.
                    Campaign and multiplayer will be added if time allows.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The storyline serves as a backdrop to the gameplay, enriching the player's experience without overpowering it.
                    Emphasis is placed on robust game mechanics and strategic depth, ensuring engaging gameplay. While the story offers context and emotional depth,
                    it is the strategic and tactical choices that drive the game, allowing players to immerse themselves in the challenges of command
                    during The Great War.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Many war games are either amoral or throw morality out of the window in favour of propaganda tropes. The storyline
                    of this game will address morality directly and place the blame squarely on the shoulders of the politicians who dragged their
                    nations into yet more pointless wars. The story will not be propagandistic but it will also not shy away from the blood guilt
                    incurred by the leaders of that time. Nations themselves will not be painted as good guys or bad guys in the campaign.
                    Real historic reference material will be used as inspiration for the story.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The game should not be pinned down by historical accuracy but use history as inspiration, heavy artistic licence can be used if needed
                    to improve the gaming experience. The player should have maximum agency to impact the course of the game, therefore there
                    must be scope for an outcome that differs from reality.
                </p>
                <p>

                <p>
                    Again, story mode will only be built if time allows, it's not the primary focus, gameplay is. This gives plenty of space for DLCs.
                </p>
                <h3 id="art-style">Art Style</h3>
                <p>
                    The art style of <span class="gameTitle"></span> can be summed up in a word quite easily: Grimdark atmosphere,
                    dieselpunk detail. It strikes a balance between historical accuracy and fun aesthetics.
                    While maintaining accurate proportions of units, buildings, and scenery, the details are rendered in a stylised,
                    somewhat cartoonish quality. This is complemented by thematic shades, diverging from strict realism to enhance
                    the game's atmosphere. The skies and horizons are particularly dramatic, styled with dark, ominous features
                    that create impactful backdrops, evoking the intense emotions of war. This stylistic choice aims to make the game visually
                    appealing and engaging while preserving gravitas. For visual inspiration and
                    a better understanding of this artistic direction, check out
                    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRZkRuH8A7s&list=PL_bBAU-tRdZ9eeNA9QGd6nY_lW8BY9R-_&index=4">
                        this video
                    </a> showcasing the Death Guard legion, which exemplifies a similar blend of realism and stylisation.
                    When polishing the game we should add some exciting lighting and screen shake effects on explosions and eerie effects of gas clouds creeping over battlefields.
                    A day/night/season cycle and weather should be a visual representation of certain game mechanics like visibility, gas weapons and
                    terrain movement effects (hard or soft mud based on season and weather).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Since the primary focus of <span class="gameTitle"></span> is on mechanical gameplay, the development of the art style will be a subsequent phase.
                    The initial stages of the project will concentrate on solidifying the core gameplay mechanics, ensuring they are engaging, functional,
                    and well-tuned. Once the gameplay foundation is strong the art development will commence.
                    This approach will ensure that the visual elements complement and enhance the established mechanics, rather than overpower them.
                    Because there will be many units onscreen at any one time, the computational load of visuals will be handled economically to ensure
                    performance doesn't tank.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once the mechanical aspects of the prototype are well underway, digital artists/3D
                    Modellers will be sought to handle game art. Their role will be to create the feel of game
                    aesthetics, create high-poly models and convert to sprite sheets, and create animations for presenting the demo to players and investors.
                </p>

                <h3 id="sound-and-music">Sound and Music</h3>

                <h4>Sound Design</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Sound Engineer:</strong> Similar to handling art during the demo development phase, a sound engineer will be sought to contribute his expertise to the project after the core game mechanics are solidly in place. His role will involve crafting a compelling and immersive audio landscape that enhances gameplay and narrative. This includes creating and sourcing sound effects, ambient sounds, and potentially working on the game's musical score. The sound engineer is expected to bring his own specialized tools and resources to the project, and collaborate closely with the development team to ensure the audio aligns with the game's artistic vision and gameplay dynamics.</li>
                    <li><strong>Prioritization of Sound Effects:</strong> During development, the highest priority is given to effects that directly enhance gameplay mechanics. This approach ensures that sounds crucial for player feedback, incoming artillery fire or your units carrying out orders, are developed first to aid in strategic decision-making and improve the overall gaming experience.</li>
                    <li><strong>Event Driven Sound Effects:</strong> Tailored audio cues that give players vital information about in-game events, enhancing gameplay awareness and immersion through responsive, contextual sounds. For example, a distant siren indicating an impending attack, enhancing the player's situational awareness.</li>
                    <li><strong>Context-Sensitive Ambient Sounds:</strong> Trigger specific ambient sound effects based on the player's location and the events happening around them. For example, near a battlefield, the sounds of distant artillery fire could be heard, whereas in a base camp, the focus might shift to the chatter of soldiers and the clanking of equipment.</li>
                    <li><strong>Multilingual Voice Acting for Factions:</strong> Each faction's voice acting is in its national language, enhancing authenticity and appealing to players' cultural identity, particularly in non-English speaking countries. This approach heightens immersion and personal connection to the game.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Music</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Event Driven Background Tracks:</strong> Employ more upbeat music during the final General Order of <a href="#holdTheLine">Hold The Line</a>.</li>
                    <li><strong>Royalty-Free Music:</strong> Use royalty-free music tracks available online. Websites like Incompetech or Free Music Archive offer a variety of tracks that can be used for free or with attribution.</li>
                    <li><strong>Minimalist Approach:</strong> Minimalist approach to music. Sometimes, less is more – a few well-chosen tracks can be effective for setting the mood.</li>
                    <li><strong>Public Domain Historical Music:</strong> Research and incorporate music from the era that is now in the public domain. Early 20th-century compositions might be available for use without licensing issues.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3 id="level-environment-design">Environment Design</h3>
                <p>The design of environments in <span class="gameTitle"></span> will lean on the landscapes and settings of World War I but prioritising the game's strategic and tactical gameplay over realism.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Historically Inspired Battlefields:</strong> Levels are based on real World War I battlefields, featuring authentic terrains like trenches and war-torn villages.</li>
                    <li><strong>Interactive Environments:</strong> Environments are interactive, providing tactical advantages and depth to gameplay. For example, being on a hill increases view and weapon range.</li>
                    <li><strong>Dynamic Weather and Time:</strong> Changing weather conditions and time-of-day cycles affect movement and visibility, adding strategic elements.</li>
                    <li><strong>Destructible Elements:</strong> Certain scenery features are destructible, allowing dynamic battlefield changes.</li>
                    <li><strong>Varied Scales and Perspectives:</strong> Different map scales offer a deeper gameplay experiences, 
                    from the large <a href="#strategic-map">macro strategic map</a> view, the detailed<a href="#tactical-map"> micro tactical map </a>
                    and an addiitonal scroll level to handle underground tunnel warfare.</li>
                    <li><strong>Atmospheric Detailing:</strong> Small details like spent shell casings and makeshift encampments enhance the immersive atmosphere.</li>
                </ul>


                <h3 id="user-interface">User Interface</h3>
                <p>
                    The UI of <span class="gameTitle"></span> will closely follow the established
                    RTS UI paradigm for familiarity and ease of adoption by new players.
                    Drawing inspiration from the efficient and user-friendly Age of Empires II UI
                    system, we will replicate its effectiveness without unnecessary innovation.
                    However, the aesthetic design will be tailored to fit the setting of our game,
                    enhancing the visual appeal and overall gaming experience.

                            management of numerous units without conflicts. Additionally, battlefield locations and

                        The indie game sector within the broader gaming market is witnessing a remarkable surge, underscoring its potential as a worthwhile investment. Recent data shows that indie games accounted for over 35% of all game releases on popular platforms in the past year, signalling their increasing prevalence in the market <sup><a href="https://www.superjumpmagazine.com/state-of-indie-games-survey-2023/" target="_blank">[reference]</a></sup>. Financially, indie games have shown impressive performance; for instance, in 2022, revenue generated by indie games on PC and console platforms exceeded $1 billion, highlighting their commercial viability <sup><a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/gamesindustrybiz-presents-the-year-in-number-2023" target="_blank">[reference]</a></sup>. Another significant statistic is the user engagement with indie titles. On average, indie games have seen a 150% increase in hours played over the last two years, indicating a growing consumer interest and loyalty to this genre <sup><a href="https://business.yougov.com/content/41600-us-charting-rise-indie-video-games" target="_blank">[reference]</a></sup>. This growth is attributed to several factors: the rise of digital distribution platforms like Steam and itch.io, which have widened access to the gaming market for small-scale developers; the increasing quality and variety of indie games, which often explore unique themes and gameplay mechanics not typically found in mainstream titles; and the supportive communities that rally around indie titles, often driving their success through word-of-mouth and social media. Additionally, the success of several high-profile indie games has drawn more attention to the sector, inspiring new developers and attracting more investors. These trends and figures paint a promising picture for indie game studios, suggesting that they are not only creatively valuable but also increasingly significant in the global gaming market.

                    <h5>Rekindled: Analytics of a Genre Finding Renewed Fire</h5>

                    <p>The real-time strategy (RTS) genre, once a titan of the gaming world, has undergone a fascinating transformation. While its market share and mainstream presence have undoubtedly shrunk compared to FPS and MOBA juggernauts, recent data hints at a subtle but promising resurgence. Let's delve into the numbers to paint a clearer picture.</p>

                    <h6>Market Trends:</h6>

                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Declined, but now Stabilising:</b> According to Newzoo, the RTS market saw a steady decline from 2012 to 2018, falling from 5% of the global PC market to just 1.5%. However, since then, it has stabilized, holding steady at around 1.4% in 2022. This suggests a core, dedicated audience that remains engaged.</li>
                        <li><b>Indie Spark:</b> While AAA RTS releases have become rarer, the indie scene has stepped up. According to GameDev.net, the number of new RTS titles released annually has remained constant around 100-150 since 2018. This steady stream of innovation, often focusing on tighter mechanics and streamlined controls, is attracting new players and revitalizing the community.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h6>Competitive Scene:</h6>

                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Esports:</b> While not dominating the esports landscape as in its heydays, titles like StarCraft II and Age of Empires IV maintain vibrant competitive communities. Smaller titles like Iron Harvest are also building their competitive scenes, offering opportunities for dedicated RTS players.</li>
                        <li><b>Streaming:</b> Twitch viewership for RTS games, while not in the top tiers, shows promise. According to StreamElements, StarCraft II consistently pulls in around 30,000 viewers, with Age of Empires IV and smaller titles like They Are Billions also garnering healthy audiences. This indicates continued interest and engagement from the core community.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h6>Challenges and Potential:</h6>

                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Steep Learning Curve:</b> RTS games remain notoriously challenging to master, with complex mechanics and demanding multitasking. This high barrier to entry can deter new players, limiting the genre's growth potential.</li>
                        <li><b>Console Conundrum:</b> The traditional RTS control scheme, heavily reliant on mouse and keyboard, doesn't translate well to consoles, a massive gaming market segment. Innovative control solutions or genre-specific console games are crucial for broader reach.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h6>Looking Ahead:</h6>

                    <p>The RTS genre isn't experiencing a full-blown renaissance, but it's certainly far from dead. Dedicated developers are injecting fresh ideas, a passionate community keeps the flame alive, and data suggests a stable, engaged player base. Continued accessibility improvements, innovative control schemes, and captivating new approaches to classic mechanics hold the key to rekindling the RTS fire and attracting a wider audience. While navigating the challenges, the genre has the potential to carve out a unique and thriving space in the modern gaming landscape, proving that strategic depth and real-time empire building still hold a powerful allure for players seeking a cerebral and rewarding gaming experience.</p>

                            of many, fuelled by anticipation for an immersive world. However, while Iron Harvest
                            achieved moderate commercial success, some technical issues and limitations in core
                            gameplay mechanics prevented it from fully capitalizing on its initial buzz.
                            This suggests the importance of not only fostering a compelling artistic vision but also
                            ensuring that gameplay mechanics deliver a satisfying and live up to the pre-launch hype.

                                2 tiered map system is a popular mechanic in RTS and 4x but very few games

                                experience by running high and low level control at the same time.

                            best team and best game we're capable of, we can establish a reputation as a
                            gaming studio synonymous with quality and innovation. Such a reputation naturally
                            attracts a vibrant, engaged community. This is about fostering an environment where
                            creativity thrives and each team member is greatly valued for contributing their time and skills to 
                            helping create a compelling gaming experiences. A strong studio reputation not only draws talented
                            individuals, but also cultivates a passionate player base. Their enthusiasm and
                            feedback become integral to our game development process, enabling us to continually

                            the Grimdark aesthetic of the Warhammer 40,000 universe. This audience is known

                        <p>
                            Significant market growth is evident in regions like Asia-Pacific, Latin America,
                            Eastern Europe and the Middle East, driven by the expanding middle class. This demographic shift
                            contributes to an increased spending capacity on entertainment, including video games.
                            With the rise in disposable income, these markets present a fertile ground for
                            introducing a WWI themed RTS game. These regions are very receptive to gaming experiences
                            tailored to their cultural nuances. <span class="gameTitle"></span> has the potential to capitalise
                            on this demand by incorporating historical elements relevant to these regions,
                            like the Ottoman Empire's role in the war or Latin American volunteer battalions.

                            The burgeoning growth of eSports in regions such as Asia-Pacific, Latin America, and
                            parts of Eastern Europe presents a significant opportunity for a strategic and competitive
                            RTS game. The escalating popularity of competitive gaming in these areas provides an
                            ideal backdrop to introduce our game, capitalising on the thriving eSports culture.
                            By utilizing digital distribution channels and tailored online marketing strategies,
                            the game can effectively reach the increasingly tech-savvy middle-class populations in
                            these regions. Given the heightened interest in eSports, a game that offers an engaging
                            storyline, historical themes, and immersive gameplay can captivate this growing audience.
                            Focusing on these elements, the game is well-positioned to attract not just RTS
                            enthusiasts, but also competitive gamers looking to participate in the burgeoning eSports
                            scene. This approach can help build a strong and dedicated global player base,
                            solidifying our game's presence in the rapidly expanding world of competitive gaming.

                        <h4 id="monetization-strategies">Monetisation</h4>
                        <p>
                            Until we have a working demo, our primary focus should not be on monetisation.
                            Instead, our efforts should be dedicated to developing a compelling, high-quality product.
                            However, as part of our broader marketing strategy, we should consider creating a
                            crowdfunding campaign. This approach not only helps in raising funds but more specifically in building
                            a community of early supporters and receiving valuable feedback. Post-demo completion,
                            we can explore monetisation strategies such as direct sales on Steam, cosmetic item
                            microtransactions, and participation in the Steam Trading Cards system. Using Steam
                            Keys will allow us to pay 0% fees to Steam while keeping the functionality the platform
                            provides.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Localising sales prices, a built-in functionality when releasing games on Steam, is vital for
                            accessing markets with high turnover but less disposable income per capita. A $20 price
                            tag might feel like a steal to an American gamer, but it could easily put off the large
                            gaming communities in Brazil, South Korea or Vietnam. Steam's built-in localisation functionality
                            removes this barrier, allowing us to tailor prices to each nation. This
                            strategic approach opens doors to global markets, makes the game significantly more
                            accessible, and ensures players perceive our pricing as offering excellent value relative to
                            their own economic environment.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            While mapping out a monetisation strategy is crucial for long-term sustainability, it should
                            not take precedence over crafting a truly exceptional game, especially at this early phase.
                            Our primary focus should be building a product that resonates deeply with our fans and
                            potential investors. A game brimming with passion and engaging gameplay will naturally
                            attract support and revenue in its own right. Remember, a captivating experience speaks
                            volumes, paving the way for sustainable monetisation built on a foundation of genuine
                            player love and enjoyment.

                        <h4 id="marketing-promotion">Advertising</h4>
                        <p>
                            Advertising plays a pivotal role in the success of both games and studios. Notably,
                            some AAA studios allocate as much as 50% of their multi-million dollar budget to marketing efforts,
                            highlighting the significance of effective promotion. In line with this industry insight,
                            we will leverage every available free advertising resource, with a readiness to allocate
                            funds as they become accessible. Our commitment to advertising remains steadfast,
                            regardless of our current funding status. Once we have sufficient gameplay content,
                            we will seek to welcome a new team member dedicated to advertising and
                            promotion. Here is the outline of approach to advertising, both before and after securing
                            funding:

                                <p>
                                    Social media platforms like Facebook, VK, and Twitch are ideal for posting
                                    regular updates, sharing behind-the-scenes glimpses, and actively engaging with
                                    our audience. Additionally, tapping into localised gaming communities can
                                    significantly amplify our reach. Focusing on regional markets, which are often
                                    less saturated, presents an opportunity for our game to stand out. By tailoring
                                    content and interactions to these specific audiences, we can establish a unique
                                    presence in areas where competition may be less intense, potentially capturing
                                    the attention of an engaged and dedicated user base that larger markets may
                                    overlook. This granular, localised approach can be a key strategy in differentiating our
                                    game in a challenging global marketplace.
                                </p>

                                    As part of our localisation strategy, partnering with smaller, local content
                                    creators focused on indie games can be highly impactful. Offering them early
                                    access not only garners potential reviews but also exposes our game to their
                                    region-specific audiences. This approach fosters grassroots-level marketing, the
                                    valuable "human touch", creating authentic engagement within local gaming
                                    communities. Such collaborations can effectively resonate with players on a
                                    more personal and cultural level, enhancing the visibility and appeal of our game
                                    in an organic way.

                                    fostering a sense of belonging among players. Meanwhile, a dedicated subreddit
                                    allows for deeper discussions and feedback, contributing to a community-driven
                                    growth. These platforms are integral in creating an engaged and interactive

                                    approach. By examining community engagement and behaviour patterns, we can identify
                                    the most effective channels and content types for our marketing. This data-driven
                                    strategy allows us to concentrate our efforts where they yield the best results,
                                    maximising the impact of our advertising in terms of both time and resources.
                                    Analytics provide us with the insights necessary to tailor our message to the
                                    right audience at the right time, ensuring our promotional activities are both
                                    efficient and effective.

                                <h5>After Funding</h5>
                                <p>
                                    If/when funding is secured, we can expand and improve our advertising toolbox.
                                    This increased budget will allow us to explore paid advertising options, such as
                                    targeted social media ads, collaborations with high-profile influencers, and
                                    potentially even display advertising on gaming websites. Enhanced funding also
                                    opens up opportunities for more creative and widespread campaigns. Moreover,
                                    the valuable analytics data collected during our early stages of advertising will
                                    be instrumental in this phase. This data will guide us in efficiently allocating
                                    our advertising funds, ensuring we invest in the most effective channels and
                                    strategies that have shown promising engagement and conversion rates, thus
                                    making the best use of our resources.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Creating a comprehensive press-kit is another crucial step. This kit will include
                                    high-quality game screenshots, engaging trailers, a well-crafted press release,
                                    and key information about our game. It's designed to make it easy for game
                                    journalists and bloggers to cover our story, thereby increasing our media presence.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Presenting our work at gaming conventions should be high priority. These events
                                    will be a great opportunity to showcase the game, infuse the advertising campaign
                                    with our personal enthusiasm, gain valuable feedback, and build hype directly with
                                    the gaming community. Such personal interactions can significantly boost the
                                    game's visibility and appeal. When selecting which events to attend, we'll strictly
                                    adhere to the analytic data collected from our early advertising efforts. This
                                    granular, localised approach to advertising might lead us to some exotic locations,
                                    but that's perfectly fine. Our aim is to follow the data, ensuring we target events
                                    that are most likely to attract our intended audience and provide the best
                                    opportunities for meaningful engagement, thereby maximizing the impact of our
                                    presence at the gaming event.

                <p>
                    Working with a zero budget initially, our financial strategy is straightforward: <strong>
                        We
                        must brutally bootstrap everything!
                    </strong> However, once the game reaches its early
                    access stage, we plan to initiate a crowdfunding campaign. The aim of this campaign is twofold:
                    to secure funds for a Steam launch and marketing efforts, but more importantly, to serve as a
                    form of free advertising to build awareness and cultivate a fanbase ahead of the game's release.

                        Or the company could head gently in the direction of mechanical engineering with some exciting 
                        entertainment equipment production. Regardless, much work to be done in the here and now.
