                        <strong>Concept Overview:</strong>
                        <span class="gameTitle"></span> is an RTS that
                        immerses players in the strategic and tactical challenges of World War I.
                        The game emphasizes a balance between economy, strategy and
                        real time action.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Inspiration:</strong>
                        Gameplay is heavily inspired by Age of Empires II and Kingdom Kights.
                        The artistic and thematic style is heaviliy inspried by the Death Korps of Krieg and Death Guard Legion of Warhammer 40,000.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Core Gameplay:</strong>
                        Players assume the roles of historical factions, orchestrating large-scale
                        military operations on the battlegrounds of Europe.
                        The game features large strategic decisions like research, production
                        and moving regiments, and close up fast tactial play.

                        <li>
                            <strong>Fresh Experience:</strong>
                            WWI is a very under represented theatre in gaming, only 1 in every 36 RTS games are about WWI (aprox). This gives players
                            a much wider range of new units, tactics and experiences to explore than many RTS games offer. This provides a new game studio a
                            blank canvas to work with.

                            <strong>Strategic Depth:</strong>
                            A lot of moving parts that are packaged neatly into 2 distinct map scales and
                            4 distinct tactical stages. Both small decisions and large decisions can have meaninful impact the outcome.

                            WWI intersceted pre industrial equipment and tactics with
                            the horrors of death delivered at the industrial scale. This game will capture the blend
                            of old and new in a way not seen before. A potent cocktail of cavalry charges and mustard gas,
                            Napoleonic era formations and analog targeting computers. Unique!

                    The game loop is divided between the macro and micro management of 2 maps and 4 General Orders that run in real time.
                    The 2 maps cover different scales of the battlefield, a large view of whole regions or a granular view of specific battlefields,
                    zooming with the mouse roller will switch scales. The stages of Genreal Orders are a more abstract concept but are
                    basically like "ages" in Age of Empires, levels of advancement that have requirments to reach and provide new opertunities
                    at each stage. General Orders cannot be undone once called up. There is no limitation on where anything can be built or moved but there are sensible places build and move.
                    Like building barracks in urban areas or steel foundries close to iron deposits is a good idea. But there might be good reasons to
                    build or move near or in enemy areas, like field hospitals or incusions behind enemy lines.

                    Here is a more detailed description of the game loops sections:

                                This is high level map view covers whole regions for macro management. A player uses this map view to manage
                                production, research and moving entire armies. At this scale the player handles economy like workers,
                                resource management, prodcution of units and logistics (roads, rail, shipping). The strategic map view will handle nearly all the econmy game elements
                                with very few military elements, just strategic bombing.

                                This detailed map view covers specific battlefields for micro management. The player has tight,
                                responsive control over units. The player will command individual units to
                                collect supplies, dig (gun pits, trenches, dugouts, tunnels), build (wire, lay mines, lookout posts, machine gun nests),
                                move or attack. Using hotkeys will be crucial. Most of the military game elements are handled at this scale with
                                very few economy elements handled here, just wood chopping for lumber. There is an additional layer to this map which
                                is that players can engage in tunnel warfare by digging through 3 subterrainian layers under the battlefield.

                        To call up the next General Order the player needs to pay certain resources, have certain buildings and unlock certain
                        technologies. The requirment for the next General Order increases but so do the rewards of each General Order,
                        access to new and better units and buildings, accesss to new and better upgrades on existing units and buildings.
                        Calling up the next General Order before your opponent will often put a player at an advantage but there may be some
                        situations/strategies where spending resources on increasing economy or military is more advantageous
                        than calling up the next General Order.

                <h3 id="development-roadmap">Development Roadmap</h3>
                <p>Details for the development timeline...</p>

                <h3 id="story-and-setting">Story and Setting</h3>
                <p>
                    Story mode will be a feature to implement if there is time, single player skirmish gameplay will be the primary focus.
                    Campaign and multiplayer will be added if time allows.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The storyline serves as a backdrop to the gameplay, enriching the player's experience without overpowering it.
                    Emphasis is placed on robust game mechanics and strategic depth, ensuring engaging gameplay. While the story offers context and emotional depth,
                    it is the strategic and tactical choices that drive the game, allowing players to immerse themselves in the challenges of command
                    during The Great War.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Many war games are either amoral or throw morality out of the window in favor of propaganda tropes. The storyline
                    of this game will address morality directly and place the blame squarley on the shoulders of the politicians who dragged their
                    nations into yet more pointless wars. The story will not be propegandistic but it will also not shy away from the blood guilt
                    incurred by the leaders of that time. Nations themselves will not be painted as good guys or bad guys in the campaign.
                    Real historic reference material will be used as inspiration for the story.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The game should not be pinned down by historical accuracy but use history as inspiration, heavy artistic licence can be used if needed
                    to improve the gaming experience. The player should have maximum agency to impact the course of the game, therefore there
                    must be scope for an outcome that differs from reality.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you fancy an entertaining overview of the narrative style, check <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpVtv9cA11s">this video</a>
                    about The Seige of Vraks in Warhammer 40,000.
                <p>
                    Again, story mode will only be built if time allows, it's not the primary focus, gameplay is. This gives plenty of space for DLCs.
                </p>
                <h3 id="art-style">Art Style</h3>
                <p>
                    The art style of <span class="gameTitle"></span> strikes a balance between historical accuracy and approachable aesthetics.
                    While maintaining accurate proportions of units, buildings, and scenery, the details are rendered in a stylized,
                    somewhat cartoonish quality. This is complemented by thematic shades, diverging from strict realism to enhance
                    the game's atmosphere. The skies and horizons are particularly dramatic, styled with dark, ominous features
                    that create impactful backdrops, evoking the intense emotions of war. This stylistic choice aims to make the game visually
                    appealing and engaging while preserving the gravity of the historical context. For visual inspiration and
                    a better understanding of this artistic direction, check out
                    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRZkRuH8A7s&list=PL_bBAU-tRdZ9eeNA9QGd6nY_lW8BY9R-_&index=4">
                        this video
                    </a> showcasing the Death Guard legion, which exemplifies a similar blend of realism and stylisation.
                    There should be some exciting lighting and screen shake effects on explosions and eerie effects of gas clouds creeping over battlefields.
                    A day/night/season cycle and weather should be a visual representation of certain game mechanics like visability, gas weapons and
                    terrain movement effects (hard or soft mud).
                </p>

                <p>
                    Since the primary focus of <span class="gameTitle"></span> is on mechanical gameplay, the development of the art style will be a subsequent phase.
                    The initial stages of the project will concentrate on solidifying the core gameplay mechanics, ensuring they are engaging, functional,
                    and well-tuned. Once the gameplay foundation is strong the art development will commence.
                    This approach will ensure that the visual elements complement and enhance the established mechanics rather than overpower them.
                    Because there will be many units onscreen at any one time the computational load of visuals will be handled economically to ensure
                    performance doesn't tank.
                </p>

                <h3 id="sound-and-music">Sound and Music</h3>

                <h4>Sound Design</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Sound Engineer:</strong> In line with the art development phase, a sound engineer will be engaged to contribute his expertise to the project after the core game mechanics are solidly in place. His role will involve crafting a compelling and immersive audio landscape that enhances gameplay and narrative. This includes creating and sourcing sound effects, ambient sounds, and potentially working on the game's musical score. The sound engineer is expected to bring his own specialized tools and resources to the project, and collaborate closely with the development team to ensure the audio aligns with the game's artistic vision and gameplay dynamics.</li>
                    <li><strong>Prioritization of Sound Effects:</strong> During development the highest priority is given to effects that directly enhance gameplay mechanics. This approach ensures that sounds crucial for player feedback, incoming artillery fire or your units carrying out orders, are developed first to aid in strategic decision-making and improve the overall gaming experience.</li>
                    <li><strong>Event Driven Sound Effects:</strong> Tailored audio cues that give players vital information about in-game events, enhancing gameplay awareness and immersion through responsive, contextual sounds. For example a distant siren indicating an impending attack, enhancing the players situational awareness.</li>
                    <li><strong>Context-Sensitive Ambient Sounds:</strong>Trigger specific ambient sound effects based on the player's location and the events happening around them. For example, near a battlefield, the sounds of distant artillery fire could be heard, whereas in a base camp, the focus might shift to the chatter of soldiers and the clanking of equipment.</li>
                    <li><strong>Multilingual Voice Acting for Factions:</strong>Each faction's voice acting is in its national language, enhancing authenticity and appealing to players' cultural identity, particularly in non-English speaking countries. This approach heightens immersion and personal connection to the game.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Music</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Event Driven Background Tracks:</strong> Employ more upbeat music during the final General Order of <a href="#holdTheLine">Hold The Line</a>.</li>
                    <li><strong>Royalty-Free Music:</strong>Use royalty-free music tracks available online. Websites like Incompetech or Free Music Archive offer a variety of tracks that can be used for free or with attribution.</li>
                    <li><strong>Minimalist Approach:</strong> Minimalist approach to music. Sometimes, less is more – a few well-chosen tracks can be effective for setting the mood.</li>
                    <li><strong>Public Domain Historical Music:</strong> Research and incorporate music from the era that is now in the public domain. Early 20th-century compositions might be available for use without licensing issues.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3 id="level-environment-design">Environment Design</h3>
                <p>The design of environments in <span class="gameTitle"></span> will lean on the landscapes and settings of World War I but prioritising the game's strategic and tactical gameplay over realism.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Historically Inspired Battlefields:</strong> Levels are based on real World War I battlefields, featuring authentic terrains like trenches and war-torn villages.</li>
                    <li><strong>Interactive Environments:</strong> Environments are interactive, providing tactical advantages and depth to gameplay. For example, being on a hill increases view and weapon range.</li>
                    <li><strong>Dynamic Weather and Time:</strong> Changing weather conditions and time-of-day cycles affect movement and visibility, adding strategic elements.</li>
                    <li><strong>Destructible Elements:</strong> Certain environmental features are destructible, allowing dynamic battlefield changes.</li>
                    <li><strong>Varied Scales and Perspectives:</strong> Different map scales offer a deeper gameplay experiences, from the large <a href="#strategic-map">macro strategic map</a> view, the detailed<a href="#tactical-map"> micro tactical map </a>view to underground tunnel views.</li>
                    <li><strong>Atmospheric Detailing:</strong> Small details like spent shell casings and makeshift encampments enhance the immersive atmosphere.</li>
                </ul>


                <h3 id="user-interface">User Interface</h3>
                <p>
                    The UI of <span class="gameTitle"></span> will closely follow the established
                    RTS UI paradigm for familiarity and ease of adoption by new players.
                    Drawing inspiration from the efficient and user-friendly Age of Empires II UI
                    system, we will replicate its effectiveness without unnecessary innovation.
                    However, the aesthetic design will be tailored to fit the setting of our game,
                    enhancing the visual appeal and overall gaming experience.

                                    strategically chosen for their ergonomic positioning, making them ideally
                                    suited for rapid and efficient hotkey-based gameplay. Their physical placement
                                    on the keyboard aligns seamlessly with the 5x3 grid layout of the game's
                                    options menu, facilitating intuitive and swift navigation
                                    (refer to the accompanying image for visual layout).

                        <p>
                            The on-screen control menu is designed for accessibility, with options selectable via
                            left mouse clicks and closable through right mouse clicks. While clicking on-screen
                            buttons is conventional in RTS games and will be included for familiarity, it's
                            acknowledged as less efficient for controlling gameplay. Therefore, the game will
                            emphasize the use of hotkeys, guiding players to more efficient control methods while
                            still providing the standard point-and-click interface.

                        <p>
                            Given the large number of units to manage, the standard 10 hotkeys for units may
                            prove insufficient for fast and engaging micromanagement. To address this,
                            while on the <a href="#strategic-map">macro strategic map</a>,
                            direct unit control is not available, hotkeys focusing instead on broader strategic control
                            like selecting cities, steel foundries or gun factories. Players can quickly switch to a specific <a href="#tactical-map">micro tactical map</a>
                            using a dedicated hotkey [1-0]. In this tactical view, unit hotkeys become active but are
                            localized to the currently viewed battlefield. This design ensures that each unit has a
                            unique hotkey assignment within its respective tactical map, allowing for efficient
                            management of numerous units without conflicts. Additionally, battlefield locations and
                            hotkey assignments are stored as member properties of unit objects for seamless
                            gameplay.

                    This game will be programmed at a low level using C++ and a few complementary libraries. No game engine will be used.
                    The reason is it's a project designed to increase programming skills, team management and enterprise skills.
                    Sticking to raw code provides the greatest learning environment at the cost of time. Skills gained on this project are
                    directly applicable to future projects that need low level problem solving skills making <span class="gameTitle"></span>

                <p>
                    Working with a zero budget initially, our financial strategy is straightforward.
                    However, once the game reaches its early access stage, we plan to initiate a crowdfunding
                    campaign. The aim of this campaign is twofold: to secure funds for a Steam launch
                    and marketing efforts, but more importantly, to serve as a form of free advertising to build
                    awareness and cultivate a fanbase ahead of the game's release.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Additionally, we're considering hosting an in-person launch party to celebrate the game's
                    release and connect with fans. This event is contingent on the success of the crowdfunding
                    campaign and the level of interest generated, making it an exciting but speculative prospect
                    at this stage.
